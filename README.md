# Seattle-Bird-Call-Classification
**Project Overiew**
In this project, we aim to classify bird species in Seattle based on their audio calls using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a set of audio recordings. The dataset consists of spectrograms which have been derived from audio recordings of birdcalls sounded by 12 different species.
