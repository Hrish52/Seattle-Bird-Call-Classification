# Seattle-Bird-Call-Classification
**Project Overiew**
In this project, we aim to classify bird species in Seattle based on their audio calls using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a set of audio recordings. The dataset consists of spectrograms which have been derived from audio recordings of birdcalls sounded by 12 different species.

The following two models have been developed:
1. **Binary Classification Model**: Distinguishes between two specific bird species—Northern Flicker and Steller’s Jay.
2. **Multi-class Classification Model**: Identifies calls from 12 bird species found in the Seattle area.

The models were trained on spectrograms generated from bird call audio files using deep learning techniques, with an emphasis on accuracy and efficient classification.
