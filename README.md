# Seattle-Bird-Call-Classification
This project classifies bird species in Seattle using their calls through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Two models were developed: a binary classifier for distinguishing two species and a multi-class classifier for 12 species. It demonstrates how deep learning can enhance bioacoustic monitoring and support wildlife conservation efforts.
